This repository hosts a [Praat] script for rapid auditory coding.
It is meant for use with the [Archive of Pittsburgh Language and Speech][apls], but it can be adapted to other use cases.

## What is auditory coding?

The linguistic subfield of language variation and change studies <strong>linguistic variables</strong>: speakers' choices between multiple linguistic forms that exist in the same linguistic environment.
For example, some speakers of Pittsburgh English pronounce the /aw/ vowel (the vowel sound in words like _out_ and _downtown_) more like "ah" (stereotyped as "_aht_" and "_dahntahn_").
The multiple forms of the /aw/ variable ("aw" and "ah") are known as <strong>variants</strong>.
In order to research this variable, a researcher has to listen to every token of /aw/ and manually identify whether the speaker pronounced it as "aw" or "ah".
This process, which is called <strong>auditory coding</strong>, is often tedious and time-consuming.
